# Visits Card patch (drop-in)

This archive adds two scoped widgets that do not affect global styles:

- `VisitsCard` — today's visits with 4 visible rows and internal scroll, colored status badges.
- `NextVisitsEmptyCard` — empty-state card with system Tabler icon and Apple-blue link.

Usage on HomePage has been switched to these widgets.
The original HomePage is saved as `HomePage.bak.tsx` next to it.
